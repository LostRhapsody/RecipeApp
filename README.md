# Recipe App To Do

- Quick search
  - A little button in the recipe, FAB probably, to search for a keyword inside of the recipe.
  - Good for very large recipes.
  - Ctrl-F basically.
- Split ingredients and instructions up into logical sections, i.e. "ingredients for sauce" "instructions for icing" "isntructions for cake" etc.
- Edit the recipe data in the recipe view, right now it's entirely static.
